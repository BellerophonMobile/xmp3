Installation information for the Test Dept. Framework
=====================================================
Either this software is checked out from Subversion or
it is downloaded as a source distribution. In the latter
case, which is the normal case, it is installed as follows:

Installing Test Dept. from a Source Distribution tar-file
--------------------------------------------------------- 
To install Test Dept., untar the distribution and change working
directory to that of "test-dept".  Then make sure you are running GNU
make.

To create the Makefile, issue:

> ./configure

Check that everything is hunky dory:

> make check

Then to install the framework, simply use:

> sudo make install

This should be enough.  It installs a bunch of scripts and makefile
snippets into bin and include directories, respectively.

If you have checked out the source from Subversion, you will have
to bootstrap the building process:

Installing Test Dept. from a checked out directory
--------------------------------------------------
Installing Test Dept. from a Subversion checkout requires automake.

First issue:

> aclocal && automake --add-missing && autoconf

in order to create the configure script.  Then you can continue
creating the makefile as described above.
