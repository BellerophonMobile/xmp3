These examples are part of the Test Dept. framework.
To compile and run them, install Test Dept. on your
system and issue "make check" in each folder.

The examples are actually possible to compile without
installing Test Dept.  Instructions for this kind of
trick is included in each project's Makefile. This
approach is however not recommended.
