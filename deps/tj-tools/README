tj-tools is essentially a collection of C code snippets providing
small, reusable data structures or functionality.

Current functionality includes:

* A macro-ized, compile time type checked heap array.
* An expandable data or string buffer.
* Template variable expansion within a buffer.


[ Use ]

Copy the appropriate files into your project.  There is not a single
tj-tools[.a|.so] library or such.


[ Documentation ]

Each of the .h files are reasonably commented.  Further documentation
is available in the tj-tools wiki:
